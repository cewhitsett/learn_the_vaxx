But, here’s the facts: No steps were skipped in the development process of the vaccine because scientists were able to leverage pre-existing technology.

 3: {'title': 'Don’t vaccines inject you with the virus in order to trigger your immune system?',
  'text': 'There are different kinds of vaccines. The kind you’re thinking of is called a live attenuated vaccine. These vaccines inject a weaker, asymptomatic form of the virus into your body, but won’t make you sick.\r\n***WHICH VACCINE IS MRNA.***However the COVID vaccine is an mRNA vaccine, a new kind of vaccine that has been in development for many years. The mRNA vaccine does not introduce the virus into your body. It instead gives your cells instructions to make a “spike protein” like the one found in the virus. Your body will recognize these spike proteins as foreign and create an immune response to get rid of them, so if it recognizes any new spike proteins being introduced to your body--the coronavirus--it will protect you against having a serious reaction! \r\nAnd if you’re worried about the vaccine altering your DNA, don’t! It does not go to the nucleus of your cells so it doesn’t affect your DNA at all. The mRNA is destroyed after it does its job.',

And just by being Black you are 1.1x as likely to catch coronavirus than white people. Around 155 out of 100,000 Black Americans have died from COVID-19 complications as of 2/2/21.\r\nMany Black Americans suffer from conditions that predispose them to having severe effects from COVID, such as (list conditions). If you or the people around you have any of these, you should get the vaccine for protection.\r\nIf you’re not concerned for your own safety, think about the safety of the people around you: parents, siblings, grandparents, uncles, aunts, cousins, friends, neighbors, etc.\r\nYou may be healthy and not have bad symptoms if you catch COVID, but others may not be so lucky.
