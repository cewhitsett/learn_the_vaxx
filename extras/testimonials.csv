Frederick, President of Howard University",https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1068234991526731777/I4gk5nRp.jpg,"""The vaccines that are coming to market are safe and have been proven to be more than 90% effective. However, we can’t get to the other side of this pandemic without you. Wear a mask, keep your social distance, wash your hands and, when the time comes, get vaccinated."""
"Anita Jenkins, Howard University Hospital",http://ndccdn.net/speakers/180x180/anita-adams-jenkins.jpg,"""I understand there is a lot of hesitancy in minority communities across the country when it comes to healthcare, but this is not an American experiment on Black people. The vaccine is a worldwide cure to end a global pandemic and set us on a path back to normalcy."""
"Dr. Yves Duroseau, First doctor to receive the vaccine",https://fadapi.northwell.io/images/providers/dr-yves-michel-duroseau-md-mph-11354157.jpg,"“We all have personal impacts of the last year. This vaccine offers an opportunity to end this long, painful journey. It’s our most powerful weapon yet in this fight, and provides a chance of returning to whatever “normal” will be in the months to come. We need to all participate in this final stage. It’s paramount to our safety and to our communities."""
"Sandra Lindsay, First person in the US vaccinated",https://dam.northwell.edu/m/1deed33bc67aecfd/Drupal-NEWS_First-nurse-in-US-to-receive-COVID-vaccine-gets-second-dose.jpg,"""I hope everyone around the world has this same opportunity. And I hope that in my community, the minority community, people won't be discouraged. We need everyone to take the vaccine. We need to eradicate the pandemic. And this is one of the only ways that we will get rid of COVID-19 and to get back to some degree of normalcy.”"
"Dr. Kizzmekia Corbett, Key lead researcher behind Moderna vaccine",https://nul.org/sites/default/files/2020-12/Dr.%20Kizzmekia%20Corbett_0.jpg,"""I could never sleep at night if I developed anything — if any product of my science came out — and it did not equally benefit the people that look like me."""

",https://www.meharry-vanderbilt.org/sites/default/files/people/hildreth-portrait-225.jpg,"“Tuskegee was horrible...This is nothing like Tuskegee because we have been involved at every level of developing the vaccine from the beginning. The scientists who were involved in creating it to the ones involved in approving it, we’ve been involved at every level, at all phases.” 
“None of the steps typically involved in evaluating the safety of a vaccine were omitted...They’re all there, they’re all done to completion, and they all demonstrate that the vaccine is safe and effective.” 
“This idea of DNA being damaged or our genes being changed, that’s been addressed...There are no microchips to monitor people and where they go; it would be impossible to do in a biological vaccine like this. But I think what health care professionals should do, they should get the information they need to feel comfortable about the vaccine and then share that with their patients.”"
"Dorothy Roberts, JD, University of Pennsylvania",https://www.law.upenn.edu/cf/faculty/roberts1/roberts1.jpg,"“It’s not just that there was a past history of medical experimentation on Black people that makes them suspicious of new technologies today. There is a continuing practice of racism in medicine and government policies that many Black people have experienced themselves. That’s why there’s a skepticism about the government rollout of the vaccine. It’s a rational skepticism, and the only way to address it is to work toward ending the racism in medicine and health care that caused the skepticism in the first place.”"
